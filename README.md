# E Learning WebApp With User Dashboard

E-learning web application with a user dashboard using React and Tailwind CSS.
In this project, we'll leverage React's component-based architecture to create reusable UI elements like course cards, user profiles, and navigation components. 

<!-- Tailwind CSS will allow us to rapidly style these components using utility classes, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface.

Key features will include user authentication, API integration for fetching course data, and a dashboard to track enrolled courses and progress. With React Router, we'll manage navigation between different sections of the application, while ensuring accessibility and performance optimizations throughout the development process. -->
